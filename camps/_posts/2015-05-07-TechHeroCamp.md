<h3>Suitable for Ages 8-10</h3>
<p>
This Tech Hero camp aims to instill the concept that technology is a creator’s tool to the young curious minds. Through fun software, games, and hardware projects, they can create apps, design games and even make robots. </p>
<p>
Our camps has a blend of hands-on work on computers together with un-plugged activities. Utilising the most advanced educational tools developed in the Silicon Valley including MIT's Scratch, Java Programming with Minecraft and Littlebits Electronics, students will come to understand technology as a tool to solve problems and create useful things. </p>
<p>
At the end of the camp our student would have moved beyond playing games, and begin to see what goes on behind and create their own games and DIY robots. </p>


<h3>Suitable for Ages 11-15</h3>
<p>
This Tech Hero camp aims to empower pre-teens with new skills in the technology front. Rather than downloading apps, they will build their own apps; Instead of playing games, this time they will create their own games.</p>
<p>
From introducing fundamental computer science concepts to hands on programming skills through projects, student use cutting age technological tool such as App Inventor by MIT, Java programming with Minecraft and littleBits to create mobile apps, learn game design and apply design thinking process.</p>
<p>
At the end of the week, they would have taken their first steps transforming from consumers of technology to creators using technology.</p>
